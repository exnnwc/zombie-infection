#Zombie Infection

TODO 
Integrate the cycle for game.run and player movement.
~~Definitely change the delay in movement. Start with removing it and see how hard it is to kill reds.~~
~~It needs to be clearer when reds are shooting. This can be accomplished by:~~
    ~~Have the individual red that is shooting be flagged by switching to an alternative number. (6 instead of 4)~~
    ~~Then change them symbol that represents that red and maybe create lines from the red in all directions.~~
    ~~Or maybe even in the direction. (A number could be assigned to each direction to indicate.)~~
It might be better if zombies walk in a straight line instead of wander randomly.
